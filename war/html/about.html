	 <h1 class="about_title">About Course</h1>
	 <p class="about_description">I was originally asked to write this course for the high schools of the Garland Independent School District as part of the new Computer Science curriculum. That course was hosted on Moodle and, as of January 1, 2015 the course is still being taught at those eight high schools; however, after many requests I decided to bring this course to a larger audience.<p>Over Winter Break (Jan. 4th - Jan. 16th, 2015) I created this website and adapted the existing course to fit into this new medium. I hope you enjoy it and that it helped you learn how to develop great Android applications, <a class="link" href="#contact_div">contact me</a> if you have any questions, suggestions, complaints, etc.</p>

	 <h1 class="about_title">About Company/Developer</h1>
	 <p class="about_description">Android&gtApple was founded in August 2011 and the first published application was released on Sep. 12, 2011. Currently Android&gtApple is run by its founder and CEO, Spencer Shadley.</p>
	 <p>I founded this company my senior year of high school and my superintendent liked what I was doing so he asked me to develop <a href="#about_course_div" class="link">a course</a> teaching other students how to develop Android applications. After developing this course, I attended (and am currently attending) The University of Texas at Austin to study Computer Science. During the Summer of 2014 I worked for IBM and for the Summer of 2015 I will be working at eBay.</p>
	 <p>I enjoy doing random projects to broaden my knowledge like this (it is my first website) and these projects have taught me even more than my school. I will continue working on my skills to develop better Android applications and website applications but have also ventured into Blackberry Application Development, iOS, Java, etc. As of Jan. 15th 2015, I have 40,000+ Android application downloads and one of my apps was featured as Amazon's App of the Day.</p>
	 <p>It's a lot of fun and if you enjoy this course I highly recommend branching out and trying new technologies to complement your Android expertise.</p>

	 <h1 class="about_title">Help: Navigating the Website</h1>
	 <p>When opening <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../index.html">the website</a>, you should be greeted with a list of units (one through six) covering various Android topics. These units are the primary blocks of the website and where you will be spending most of your time. These units are broken into several sections, typically three. To access these sections you must click the appropriate button found at the bottom of the page (the blue circle thing.) Additionally, there are about pages and a resources page you can explore! Most pages are directly accessible through the navigation bar at the top of every page. Within this navigation bar you can expand units to choose a specific topic or expand the about for the appropriate pages there. Finally, if you would like to quickly find something or are having trouble locating it, try using the search box at the top of the page.</p>

	 <h1 class="about_title">Help: Units</h1>
	 <p class="about_description">This course is broken into six sections: Introduction to Android, Creating your First App, More about Widgets, Organizing it all Together, Final Projects and Publish.</p>
	 <p>The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../html/tutorial-intro.html">first unit</a> is intended to help you get started with Android development. It demonstrates how to setup an Android Development Environment with Eclipse and discusses terminology for Android development.</p>
	 <p>In the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../html/tutorial-create.html">second unit</a> second unit a few Android widgets are described and you are expected to make your first Android application. An optional project and test accompany this unit.</p>
	 <p>For the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../html/tutorial-widgets.html">third unit</a>, a plethora of Android widgets are explored to give the student more breadth in their Android abilities. After this, the necessary layouts and Activities for developing Android applications are explained. Optional quizzes are supplied for the third section of the unit.</p>
	 <p>In the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../html/tutorial-organize.html">fourth unit</a>, the student's Android abilities are solidified as this is the final learning unit available. The 'glue' of Android applications are discussed such as the Android Manifest, Intents, SharedPreferences, Content Provider, ActionBar and tabs.</p>
	 <p>Once the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../html/tutorial-projects.html">fifth unit</a> is reached, the student is expected to have already amassed a variety of Android application skills and is expected to build their first solo project as well as their first group project.</p>
	 <p>Finally, the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../html/tutorial-publish.html">sixth unit</a> is intended to help publish those great Android applications that were just created. Where and how to publish Android applications are covered as well as how to make money on those apps!</p>
